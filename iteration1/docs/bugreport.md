### Robot Simulator Iteration 1 Bug Report

#### Name: Quang Phung

1. The robot sometimes has a weird motion when touching a base
2. When an obstacle touches an entity, in stead of backing up in an arc,
   it will back up straight for 2 seconds, then turns its head 45 degrees
   and goes straight to avoid the obstacle.
